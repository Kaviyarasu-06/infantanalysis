# Baby Health Data Analysis 🍼

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`baby.ipynb`) focused on analyzing newborn health data and identifying key health risk patterns such as jaundice levels and gender-based birth statistics.

## 📘 Project Overview
The notebook performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset named **`newborn_health_monitoring_with_risk (1).csv`**.  
It aims to understand the distribution of health indicators among newborns and highlight potential risks.

## 🧩 Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using **Pandas** and **NumPy**
- Exploratory analysis and visualization with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
- Skewness analysis for identifying biased features
- Insights into **gender distribution** among newborns
- Visual plots for comparative understanding of health metrics

## 📊 Dataset
- **File:** `newborn_health_monitoring_with_risk (1).csv`
- **Attributes:** Includes variables such as `jaundice_level`, `gender`, and other newborn health metrics.
- **Purpose:** To study patterns and identify anomalies in neonatal health data.
